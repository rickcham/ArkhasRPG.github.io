<ul>
Cantrips:
 <li title="Action: 1 Minute;V,S,M(Two Lodestones);This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, or a torn cloak. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. The spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.">Consertar,</li>
 <li title="Action; 60ft; A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.">raio de gelo</li>
</ul>

<ul>
1:<li title="Reaction; V,S;The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type.">absorver elementos,</li>
  <li title="Action; Concentration(10 minutes);For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.">detectar magia,</li>
  <li title="Action; V; Concentration(1 minute); 60ft;Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light, and attack rolls against affected creatures or objects have advantage if the attacker can see them.">fogo das fadas,</li>
  <li title="Action; V,S; 120ft;You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice within range that you can see. A dart deals 1d4+1 force damage. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several. "> mísseis mágicos,</li> 
  <li title="Action; V,S,M(A pearl worth at least 100gp, feather);You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magically imbued object, you learn its properties, how to use them, whether it requires attunement, and how many charges it has (if any). You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.">identificação,</li>
  <li title="Action; V,S;A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.">onda de trovão,</li>
  <li title="Action; V,S; Concentration (1 minute); 30ft;A stream of acid emanates from you in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for the spell’s duration. A creature covered in acid takes 2d4 acid damage at the start of each of its turns until it uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off."> Tasha's caustic brew</li>
