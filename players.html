<p>Ele possui um Kit de Desfarce e Ferramentas de Ladrão e suas magias são 
<ul>
Cantrips:
 <li title="Action: 1 Minute;V,S,M(Two Lodestones);This spell repairs a single break or tear in an object you touch, such as a broken chain link, two halves of a broken key, or a torn cloak. As long as the break or tear is no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, you mend it, leaving no trace of the former damage. The spell can physically repair a magic item or construct, but the spell can’t restore magic to such an object.">Consertar,</li>
 <li title="Action; 60ft; A frigid beam of blue-white light streaks toward a creature within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 1d8 cold damage, and its speed is reduced by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.">raio de gelo</li>
</ul>

<ul>
1:<li title="Reaction; V,S;The spell captures some of the incoming energy, lessening its effect on you and storing it for your next melee attack. You have resistance to the triggering damage type until the start of your next turn. Also, the first time you hit with a melee attack on your next turn, the target takes an extra 1d6 damage of the triggering type.">absorver elementos,</li>
  <li title="Action; Concentration(10 minutes);For the duration, you sense the presence of magic within 30 feet of you. If you sense magic in this way, you can use your action to see a faint aura around any visible creature or object in the area that bears magic, and you learn its school of magic, if any.">detectar magia,</li>
  <li title="Action; V; Concentration(1 minute); 60ft;Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also outlined if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects and affected creatures shed dim light, and attack rolls against affected creatures or objects have advantage if the attacker can see them.">fogo das fadas,</li>
  <li title="Action; V,S; 120ft;You create three glowing darts of magical force. Each dart hits a creature of your choice within range that you can see. A dart deals 1d4+1 force damage. The darts all strike simultaneously, and you can direct them to hit one creature or several. "> mísseis mágicos,</li> 
  <li title="Action; V,S,M(A pearl worth at least 100gp, feather);You choose one object that you must touch throughout the casting of the spell. If it is a magic item or some other magically imbued object, you learn its properties, how to use them, whether it requires attunement, and how many charges it has (if any). You learn whether any spells are affecting the item and what they are. If the item was created by a spell, you learn which spell created it.">identificação,</li>
  <li title="Action; V,S;A wave of thunderous force sweeps out from you. Each creature in a 15-foot cube originating from you must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 2d8 thunder damage and is pushed 10 feet away from you. On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage and isn’t pushed.">onda de trovão,</li>
  <li title="Action; V,S; Concentration (1 minute); 30ft;A stream of acid emanates from you in a line 30 feet long and 5 feet wide in a direction you choose. Each creature in the line must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be covered in acid for the spell’s duration. A creature covered in acid takes 2d4 acid damage at the start of each of its turns until it uses its action to scrape or wash the acid off."> Tasha's caustic brew</li>

<li title="Action;V,S,M(a piece of iron and a flame); Concentration(1 minute);60ft;
hoose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. 
You cause the object to glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire damage when you cast the spell.
Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.
If a creature is holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it,
 the creature must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can.
If it doesn’t drop the object,
 it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.">Heat Metal</li>

<ul>
 Magias LV 0: <li title="Action;S,M(a weapon worth at least a SP);
 You brandish the weapon used in the spell’s casting and make a melee attack with it
 against one creature within 5 feet of you. On a hit, the target suffers the weapon attack’s normal effects
 and then becomes sheathed in booming energy until the start of your next turn.
 If the target willingly moves 5 feet or more before then,
 the target takes 1d8 thunder damage, and the spell ends.">Booming Blade</li>

   the target takes 1d10+charisma modifier of force damage.">Agonizing Blast

</ul>

<ul>Magias LV 1:
 <li title="Action;V,S,M(a cup of water); 1 hour;
   A protective magical force surrounds you,
   manifesting as a spectral frost that covers you and your gear.
   You gain 5 temporary hit points for the duration.
   If a creature hits you with a melee attack while you have these hit points,
   the creature takes 5 cold damage."> Armor of Agathys
  </li>

  <li title="Bonus Action;V,S,M(petrified eye of a newt);Concentration(1 hour);
   You place a curse on a creature that you can see within range.
   Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack.
   Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell.
   The target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability.

   you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to curse a new creature.">Hex

  <li title="Action;V; concentration(1 minute);
   Your body becomes blurred, shifting and wavering to all who can see you.
   For the duration, any creature has disadvantage on attack rolls against you.

  <li title="">Thaumaturgy</li>
</ul>

<ul>Magias LV 1:
<li title="Bonus Action;V,S,M(petrified eye of a newt);Concentration(1 hour);
 You place a curse on a creature that you can see within range.
 Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6 necrotic damage to the target whenever you hit it with an attack.
 Also, choose one ability when you cast the spell.
 The target has disadvantage on ability checks made with the chosen ability.
 If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends,
 you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to curse a new creature.">Hex
</li>

<li title="Action;V,S;
 As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread,
 a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips.
 Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw.
 A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save,
 or half as much damage on a successful one.">Burning hands
</li>

<li title="Action;V;
 You speak a one-word command to a creature you can see within range.
 The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or follow the command on its next turn.
 The spell has no effect if the target is undead, if it doesn’t understand your language,
 or if your command is directly harmful to it. Some typical commands and their effects follow.
 You might issue a command other than one described here.
 If you do so, the DM determines how the target behaves.
 If the target can’t follow your command, the spell ends.
 Approach. The target moves toward you by the shortest and most direct route,
 ending its turn if it moves within 5 feet of you.    
 Drop. The target drops whatever it is holding and then ends its turn.    
 Flee. The target spends its turn moving away from you by the fastest available means.          
 Grovel. The target falls prone and then ends its turn.
 Halt. The target doesn’t move and takes no actions.
 A flying creature stays aloft, provided that it is able to do so.
 If it must move to stay aloft, it flies the minimum distance needed to remain in the air.">Command
</li>

<li title="Action;V,S; 1 hour;
 You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons,
 and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends
 or until you use your action to dismiss it.
 You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between.
 You can’t change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs.
 Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
 The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection.
 For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit,
 objects pass through the hat,
 and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair.
 If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are,
 the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
 To discern that you are disguised,
 a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation)
 check against your spell save DC."> Disguise Self
</li>

<li title="Action;V,S;10ft;
All nonmagical food and drink within a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range
 is purified and rendered free of poison and disease."> Purify Food and Drink,</li>
<li title=""> Find Familiar</li>
